# seasonbot
seasonbot is a simple algorithm which plans The Runaway Company's season calendar whilst avoiding non-ideal show dates such as Chinese New Year or university finals. At the same time, it is hoped that transparency regarding all significant production dates will allow for consistent theatre bookings and help potential participants plan their lives around TRC productions.
